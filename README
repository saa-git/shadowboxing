# Shadowbox
This is an implementation of the game from TikTok "Shadowboxing".

# How to Play Shadowboxing
Shadowboxing has 2 roles, a pointer and a looker, which alternate per round.
There are at least 2+ players.

The pointer will point in a cardinal direction of their choice.
The looker must look in a direction at the same time that the pointer points.

If the looker looks in the same direction of the point, the pointer gets to go again.
The pair are now in a pattern, both players repeat all of the previous moves the current looker messed up on, adding a new matchup to the end.
They repeat until the looker breaks out of the pattern or repeats [lives] amount of times in a row.
This moves the game to a new round either switching roles in 2-player, or moving along the ring.

# How To Play Shadowbox
When you open the application, you are shown that game's title for 2 secs.
The game will automatically start.

The next screen will show the current round and the amount of lives either player has.
At the bottom, the game will also prompt you to press an arrow or WASD Key.

When you press a (valid) button, it will compare the players choice with the bot's choice.

The second screen loops until someone loses all of their lives.
